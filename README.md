# tslint-config-pikadude

hi i don't expect or intend for anyone to use this. it's my eslint config (for typescript) that i use a lot and yarn gets angry when it's private in some conditions. that's the only reason why it's public lol. also despite the name it's actually designed for eslint but i already have an eslint config for js with eslint in the name.

`yarn add --dev @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser eslint eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-json eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort eslint-plugin-sort-class-members eslint-plugin-unused-imports prettier prettier-eslint https://github.com/PikaDude/tslint-config-pikadude.git`
